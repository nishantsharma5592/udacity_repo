# udacity_repo
 This is a repository to gain familiarity with git and Github.
    I am adding the following git commands that I am already familiar with:
            git clone
            git add
            git commit -m
            git push

Although I must note that the GitHub Desktop does a fine job doing most of the elbow greasing.
